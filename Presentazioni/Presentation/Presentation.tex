\begin{frame}{PM_{10}}

Airborn particulate matter (PM) is a complex mixture of particles that varies in size and chemical composition.

For regulatory purposes particles are defined by their diameter measured in microns.



\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Where do they come from?}

PM may be either directly emitted from sources (primary particles) or formed in the atmosphere through chemical reactions.
PM10 are often emission from:
\begin{itemize}
    \item combustion processes
    \item construction sites
    \item landfills and agriculture
    \item wildfires
    \item pollen
    \item fragments of bacteria
\end{itemize}
    

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Health consequences}
$PM_{10}$ particles can be inhaled, and they deposit on the surfaces of the larger airways of the upper region of the lung inducing tissue damage and lung inflammation.\\
Short-term exposures to $PM_{10}$ have been associated primarily with worsening of respiratory diseases leading to hospitalization and emergency department visits.\\
The effects of long-term exposure to $PM_{10}$ are less clear, although several studies suggest a link between long-term  exposure and respiratory mortality. 

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Limit values}
For the protection of human health The EU and the OMS have set two limit values for particulate matter:
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline 
 & Europe & OMS \\ 
\hline 
annual limit & $40 \mu g / m_3$ & $20 \mu g / m_3$ \\ 
\hline 
daily limit & $50 \mu g / m_3$   max 35 days/year & $50 \mu g / m_3$ max 3 days \\
\hline 
\end{tabular} 

\end{frame}

\section{Dataset}
\begin{frame}{Dataset}
    We have the measures of the concentration of $PM_{10}$ taken from n station over the Po valley and from 2014\\
    
    We are going to focus on the stations of Emilia Romagna and the measurements from 2018.
\end{frame}

\section{Objectives of the project}
\begin{frame}{Objectives of the project}

\begin{itemize}
    \item create an ARIMA model that best represent the problem
    \item make predictions on the short term of the concentration of $PM_{10}$
   
\end{itemize}
